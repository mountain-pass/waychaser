Feature: Invoke Operation

    So that I can perform actions on a resource
    As a developer
    I want to be able to invoke operations

    Scenario: Invoke operation - self
        Given a resource with a "self" operation that returns itself
        When waychaser successfully loads that resource
        And we successfully invoke the "self" operation
        Then the same resource will be returned

    Scenario: Invoke operation error
        Given a resource with a "error" operation that returns an error
        When waychaser successfully loads that resource
        And we invoke the "error" operation
        Then it will NOT have loaded successfully

    Scenario: Invoke operation - next
        Given a resource returning status code 200
        And a resource with a "next" operation that returns that resource
        When waychaser successfully loads the latter resource
        And we successfully invoke the "next" operation
        Then the former resource will be returned

    Scenario: Invoke operation - missing
        Given a resource returning status code 200
        When waychaser successfully loads the latter resource
        Then invoking a missing operation will immediately return undefined

    Scenario: Invoke operation - list
        Given a list of 4 resources linked with "next" operations
        When waychaser successfully loads the first resource in the list
        And invokes each of the "next" operations in turn 3 times
        Then the last resource returned will be the last item in the list

    Scenario Outline: Invoke operation - parameterised
        Given a resource with a "https://waychaser.io/rel/pong" operation that returns the provided "ping" "<TYPE>" parameter
        When waychaser successfully loads that resource
        And we invoke the "https://waychaser.io/rel/pong" operation with the input
            | ping | pong |
        Then resource returned will contain those values

        Examples:
            | TYPE  |
            | query |
            | path  |

    Scenario Outline: Invoke operation - parameterised with extra params
        Given a resource with a "https://waychaser.io/rel/pong" operation that returns the provided "ping" "<TYPE>" parameter
        When waychaser successfully loads that resource
        And we invoke the "https://waychaser.io/rel/pong" operation with the input
            | ping  | pong    |
            | other | notUsed |
        Then resource returned will contain only
            | ping | pong |

        Examples:
            | TYPE  |
            | query |
            | path  |


    Scenario Outline: Invoke operation - methods
        Given a resource with a "https://waychaser.io/rel/do-it" operation with the "<METHOD>" method returning status code <CODE>
        When waychaser successfully loads that resource
        And we invoke the "https://waychaser.io/rel/do-it" operation
        Then resource returned will have the status code <CODE>

        Examples:
            | METHOD | CODE |
            | DELETE | 204  |
            | POST   | 201  |
            | PUT    | 204  |
            | PATCH  | 204  |

    Scenario Outline: Invoke operation - methods with location response
        Given a resource returning status code 200
        And a resource with a "https://waychaser.io/rel/do-it" operation with the "<METHOD>" method returning a location to that resource
        When waychaser successfully loads that resource
        And we successfully invoke the "https://waychaser.io/rel/do-it" operation
        And we successfully invoke the "related" operation
        Then the former resource will be returned

        Examples:
            | METHOD | CODE |
            | DELETE | 204  |
            | POST   | 201  |
            | PUT    | 204  |
            | PATCH  | 204  |

        And we invoke the "https://waychaser.io/rel/pong" operation with the input

            | ping  | pong    |
            | other | notUsed |

    Scenario Outline: Invoke operation - multiple parameters of different type, including body
        Given a resource with a "https://waychaser.io/rel/pong" operation with the "<METHOD>" method that returns the following "<CONTENT-TYPE>" provided parameters and the content type
            | NAME    | TYPE    |

    Scenario: Invoke operation - options
        Given a resource with a "https://waychaser.io/rel/pong" operation returns the provided "test" header
        When waychaser successfully loads that resource
        And we invoke the "https://waychaser.io/rel/pong" operation with the headers
            | test | value |
        Then resource returned will contain only
            | test | value |
