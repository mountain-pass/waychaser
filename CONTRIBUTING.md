## Reporting issue

Please report issues or request features in the [waychaser issues register](https://github.com/mountain-pass/waychaser/issues).

## Development

### Folder Structure

All the source code is inside the `src` directory. All the test source code is in `src/test` directory

### Testing

This software uses cucumber with different clients for interacting with the API, either directly or via Web Driver (for making sure the library works in the browser), `node-api` and `browser-api`.

Each interface has the same behaviour as described by the [cucumber scenarios](./src/test). Different test clients are used to interact with each interface.

The tests for these clients can be run using the `test:node-api` and `test:browser-api` npm scripts respectively.

To run all the tests, run `npm run test`

While developing, the `watch:test:*` npm scripts act as their `test:*` counterparts, but will automatically re-execute each time you change a relevant file.

The normal development cycle against a new backend API is:

1. Add scenario to feature file
2. run `npm run watch:test:node-api`
3. write code until the scenario passes
4. commit
5. run `npm run watch:test:browser-api`
6. write code until the scenario passes
7. commit
8. run `npm run test` to make you didn't break anything else along the way
9. run `npm run cover` and remove dead code
10. commit and push

### ðŸš«ðŸ’©

If committing fails, check your commit logs.

There is a pre-commit hook, that:

- lint's the code,
- runs the `test:node-api` npm script

Please don't force commit. Fix your ðŸ’© and then try again. If you need help, ask.

If you force commit ðŸ’© then you could get...

### Contribution flow

A rough outline of an ideal contributors' workflow is as follows:

- Fork the current repository
- Create a topic branch from where to base the contribution. Mostly, it's the main branch.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Push changes in a topic branch to your forked repository.
- Before sending out the pull request, please sync your forked repository with the remote repository to ensure that your PR is elegant, concise. Reference the guide below:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:mountain-pass/waychaser.git
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
git checkout -b your_awesome_patch
... add some work
git push origin your_awesome_patch
```

- Submit a pull request to mountain-pass/waychaser and wait for the reply.
